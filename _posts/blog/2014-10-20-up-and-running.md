[Jekyll][jekyll] is the easiest way to build your blogs. And you can do free hosting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) pages.

> Jekyll supports markdown. This is an indented line.

Markdown supports simple headers as below.

### Hello World!

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

You can do simple but powerful things with [Jekyll][jekyll] and Markdown. **Have Fun!** 

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].

I used the awesome [SO Simple theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/). Follow the instructions [here](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/theme-setup/)
