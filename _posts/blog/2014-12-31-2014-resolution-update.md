I am usually not into making New Year Resolutions except once in 2005. That was the year I decided to reduce weight and I successfully completed it and continue it as a habit still (ahem I would say somewhat :) ).

I view resolutions as something not particular to that year rather forming a lifelong habit. I consider January 1st as a date of convenience and symbolic. If I wanted something to start I would rather as well start than wait for Jan 1st.

**_So what happened last year in 2014 and did I make a resolution?_**

I did make resolutions in 2014 and I will update them below, but before that why?

1. I needed a motivation to challenge myself to try something.
2. I wanted to create more time for myself and remove myself from distractions.
3. I felt I needed to focus and work on things that are important.
4. Am aging fast physically and I needed to support my body.

**_2014 Resolutions - Why & What, and how did I fare?_**

* Stop at the Salad Bar everyday and eat Salads. - 50% Success.

>> Eat more vegetables and fruits, if possible raw and that was the resolution. I don’t carry my lunch and was eating at office. The side effect of this was an  alarming cholesterol levels when I went for a full body checkup. My family and myself were shocked. Idid start eating at Salad Bar as much as possible but not always. My cholesterol rates had come down drastically. Will rate achievement at 50% as I did skip this when Saravana Bhavan was introduced at office.

* Stop Reading Newspapers and watching News Channels - 90% Success

>> As per several people, if a news is worthwhile it will reach you through your family or friends and it made sense. When I told people about this resolution, people told me that I will get the views of other people and not necessarily the news. Considering the negativity that’s projected as news everyday I felt it’s OK. I made Saturday, Sunday and Monday morning Economic Times as the cheat days and I have newspapers only on those days and that too mostly news related to Sports and Business. _I did watch news when Election Results were announced and when Jayalalitha got convicted_.

* Read 12 books in 2014, Read 10 pages everyday - 50% success

>> This resolution was made midway in January and was made with my friend Saju. We did buy 12 books and I completed 6 of them. **Best resolution I made - reading everyday has become an everyday habit**. My reading speed has improved and my focus on reading books for a longer time has improved from where I started last year. This resolution will be carried into the next year.

* Learn to write in Left Hand, Right a page every day - Deferred to 2015

>> Since I picked the above resolution, I decided to defer this to 2015.

You may notice that some resolutions are written as outcomes, _some are written with outcomes and what I need to do for that resolution_. This was something that I learnt last year and planning to implement in next year too.
