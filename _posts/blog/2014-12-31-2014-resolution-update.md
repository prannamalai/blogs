I am usually not into making New Year Resolutions except once in 2005. That was the year I decided to reduce weight and I successfully completed it and continue it as a habit still (ahem I would say somewhat :) ).

I view resolutions as something not particular to that year rather forming a lifelong habit. I consider January 1st as a date of convenience and symbolic. If I wanted something to start I would rather as well start than wait for Jan 1st.

**_So what happened last year in 2014 and did I make a resolution?_**

I did make resolutions in 2014 and I will update them below, but before that why?

1. I needed a motivation to challenge myself to try something new.
2. I wanted to create more time for myself and remove myself from distractions.
3. Am aging fast physically and I needed to support my body by taking good care of it.

**_2014 Resolutions - Why & What, and how did I fare?_**

* Stop at the Salad Bar for lunch everyday and eat Salads. - 50% Success - Continue in 2015

> Eat more vegetables and fruits, if possible raw and that was the resolution. I don’t carry my lunch and was eating at office. The side effect of this was an  alarming cholesterol levels when I went for a full body checkup. My family and myself were shocked. I ate Salads  as much as possible but not always. My cholesterol levels had come down drastically. Will rate achievement at 50% as I did skip this when Saravana Bhavan was newly introduced at office. Will continue this in 2015.

* Stop Reading Newspapers and watching News Channels - 90% Success - Continue in 2015

> As per several people, if a news is worthwhile it will reach you through your family or friends and it made sense. When I told people about this resolution, people told me that I will get the views of other people and not necessarily the news. Considering the negativity that’s projected as news everyday I felt it’s OK. I made Saturday, Sunday and Monday morning Economic Times as the cheat days and I have newspapers only on those days and that too mostly news related to Sports and Business. _I did watch news when Election Results were announced and when Jayalalitha got convicted_.

>> I channeled the time saved to other things notably improving my tech skills.

* Read 12 books in 2014, Read 10 pages everyday - 50% success - Continue in 2015

> This resolution was made midway in January and was made with my friend Saju. We did buy 12 books and I completed 6 of them. **Best resolution I made - reading everyday has become an everyday habit**. My reading speed has improved and my focus on reading books for a longer time has improved from where I started last year. This resolution will be carried into the next year.

* Learn to write with Left Hand, Right a page every day - Deferred to 2015

> Since I picked the above resolution, I decided to defer this to 2015.

You may notice that some resolutions are written as outcomes, _some are written with outcomes and what I need to do for that resolution_. This was something that I learnt last year and planning to implement in next year too.

I consider the above resolutions as a habit now as I move to 2015.

**Have a Wonderful 2015**
