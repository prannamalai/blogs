In Southern India, especially [Tamil Nadu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu), many people follow [Skanda Sashti][sashti]. It's a 6 day religious event. Some people fast for 6 days together and some fast on the last day. 

**Mythological Significance**
[Skanda Sashti][sashti] marks the 6th day after Diwali, signifying the 6 days of war over the evil forces by [God Muruga or Kartikeya][muruga] and vanquishing them using the “Vel” (spear) given by his mother Parvati.

[Muruga][muruga] vanquished Tarakasura or Gajamugan (Elephant),  Singamukasura (Lion) and Surapadman (Humongous Tree).

**Metaphors and their Meaning**

Technically a Vel(spear) contours with a _Sharp_ Edge, an Upper Part which is _Wide_ with a _Depth_ along its length. 

>
* Sharp - points to the sharpness of our *Knowledge*.
* Wide - points to a broad *Mind*.
* Length - points to the depth of our *Knowledge*.
* Elephant - Emotions
* Lion - Pride
* Tree - Ego
>

With a broadened ***Mind and Knowledge*** (Wisdom),  an Individual conquers or vanishes the Emotions (Elephant), Pride (Lion) and Ego (Tree).
