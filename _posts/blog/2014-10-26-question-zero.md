The book <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0007592515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24790&creativeASIN=0007592515&linkCode=as2&tag=prasrock-21&linkId=PBQVG7JZSCD7LIVG" target="_blank">Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential</a><img src="http://ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prasrock-21&l=as2&o=31&a=0007592515" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> from founders of IDEO (Tom and David Kelley) is an interesting read.

It’s a gem and full of easy-to-use suggestions on enabling creative potential within us.

One of the facets to innovation is asking the right question and to spur the _“Aha moment!”_.

Here are some tips from the book:

1. Step back from Obvious solutions: 
>
>> One of the best statements from the book: Instead of trying to invent a better mousetrap, for example, look at other ways to mouse proof your home.

2. Alter your focus or point of view: 
>
>> Change your point of view and shift your focus / questions to a different stakeholder.

3. Uncover the Real Issue:
>
>>Decades ago, Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt observed, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!”. 

4. Bypass Resistance Or Mental Blocks:
>
>> When faced with mental blocks or resistance to your ideas, start thinking about questions that will show the answer in a better light from respondents and go for those questions. 

5. Think about the Opposite:
>
>> A community action program in Oklahoma faced with low parent participation rates (less than 20 percent) even though the program would help the kid’s futures. After analysis, instead of promoting the program as a free ones, the organizers started focussing on the value of the program to the parents.
